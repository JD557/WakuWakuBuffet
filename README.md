*Warning:*

As expected from a 48h competition entry, the quality of this code might hurt your eyes.

I believe that if you look at my work commit by commit, you will see a immutable game engine
become a huge mass of global mutable variables as the deadline draws near.

Description
-----------

"Welcome to Waku Waku Buffet, the best all you can eat restaurant in town!
We have 3 lanes full of delicious food, just for you!"

You just bought a full dinner at Waku Waky buffet, and you want to make sure you make the best out of your money.

Make sure you eat the food you like (chicken, burgers and sushi) and avoid the food you dislike (brocolli and soup),
as that will only make you full.

If you start to get full, don't worry, just go to the bathroom and empty your bowels ;).

You accumulate points by eating, but they will only go to your score after you go to the bathroom.
The fuller you are when you go to the bathroom, the more points you will get.

If you get too full, however, it's game over. Watch out for your fullness bar.

Itadakimasu!
